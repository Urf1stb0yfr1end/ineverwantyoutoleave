          <p class="poem-body">
Before you
life was scattered into fragments
days broken like shards of glass
I tried to gather them
but they cut my hands
and the picture never appeared
With you beside me
the fragments glow as one
the pieces arrange themselves into wholeness
the broken glass becomes a window
through which the light pours clear
Even the smallest hours
a meal shared
a walk in the quiet of evening
become light
They are no longer fragments
but living notes in a song
that was always waiting to be sung
Now I know why the world exists
why every breath feels alive
why time flows forward
Because you are here
Because you are with me
Because the emptiness is gone
and life at last makes sense

I waited for you
through years that felt unending
through nights stretched thin with silence
through hunger and restless longing
But waiting is not emptiness
It is the soil beneath the tree
the gathering of strength in roots
before branches ever appear
And when you came
you were the rain
you were the sun
you were the season that kept its promise
The years I thought wasted
are now folded into our strength
Every ache was shaping me
so I would not mistake you when you arrived
Every hour of longing
was preparing me for recognition
so I could say at once
This is the soul I was waiting for
I see now
my whole life was the seed
and you are the bloom

There is a bridge that frightens me
the Atchafalaya stretching across the waters
its endless rise and fall
its length beyond sight
When you cross it
my heart trembles
as if the whole world could conspire
to steal you away from me
But the only bridge I long for you to walk
is not of concrete or steel
It is the bridge of our own making
built from our promises

set firm with laughter
strengthened with the weight of trust
It arches over time itself
and leads not to danger
but to the life we will share
Each mile of it
is laid with the steps we have taken together
each span bright with the vision of our tomorrows
When we cross it hand in hand
there is no fear
for it rises not above peril
but above all that tried to hold us back
The Atchafalaya may stretch across waters
but our bridge stretches into forever

Though you are far
I feel you me or
You inside
My fears

You’re in every thought
Even when not
there
Even when im too afraid
To think
To even dare
Say

“I miss you”
And i’m always afraid
That fate
Or the world
Or maybe another
may
Will
Won’t
Can
take you from me
Away

I play a strong man
A lot
I play alot
A clever word
A strong card
dealt
But with you I

fold
Whatever
Whenever

I know im wrong
I know my love
I’m love
I’m in
I love you

I keep you
 in places nobody can steal
from me
Not in photos
 not in messages
 not in things that can be
gone
 or lost
I keep you
 in the way my chest warms
 when I remember your voice

 in the way my hands relax
 when I think of you
I keep you
 in the soft parts of my mind
In the hardest
My thought
My love

 where I don’t let the world in
 the parts that still believe
 in sweetness
In the parts that learned to hope
To believe
In love
Sometimes I think back
To our happiest moments
A laugh
A bear
A tiger
A mall
A bumpy ride
A ride almost gone
The bridge always the bridge,
Im at the end of the world
With you

 like a song
 just one moment
 over and over
 until it becomes a world,
the world
Ours
Yours
Mine
I need you
even if time is cruel
 even if fate acts like a thief
 there is one thing
 I wont let it touch
What we shared
What we told
Each other
In a Dream

 and I loved you
And i love you
 and you changed me

When night arrives
and the room grows wide with silence
I wake in terror
my chest rises like a storm tide
my voice breaks open
and the air feels sharp against me
But when you are here
everything changes
You are the stillness that lets me breathe
the rhythm that steadies my pulse
Your nearness is the hush of a meadow
after the rain has passed
the soft weight of dew on grass
the glow of the moon through calm clouds
Sleep is no longer a plunge into darkness
It is a shoreline where your hand anchors mine
a tide I can trust
a gentle current carrying me inward
You are the guardian of my dreams
the safety of my sleep
And when I close my eyes beside you
I fall not into fear
but into a vast and shining quiet
that knows your name
